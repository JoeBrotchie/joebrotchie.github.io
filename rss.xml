This method exploits the nature of CSS to track various characteristics about the visitor&#8217;s browser and device and permentantly store &#8217;hidden&#8217; cookies that uniquely identifies a user. This technique avoids anti-tracking methods such as noScript, VPNs or browser extensions, as it requires no Javascript or Cookies to function.</p><p>If you are interested in seeing a pre-release or if your company is hiring, please shoot me an email over at <code>o.brotchie@gmail.com</code>!</p><p>Stay tuned for more info in the next couple days. ✨</p>]]></description>
