<p><strong>An experimental method for CSS based fingerprinting and a pure CSS "supercookie".</strong></p>

<h2 id='what_is_it?'>What is it?</h2>

<p>CSS Fingerprinting is a technique of tracking and gathering information on site visitors. This method exploits the nature of CSS to collect various characteristics about the visitor&#8217;s browser and device, which can later be used to either identify or track said visitor.</p>

<h2 id='how_does_it_work?'>How does it work?</h2>

<p>By sending a variety of media queries that apply to specific browser characteristics, the browser will select a set of styles that apply to itself. We then trick the browser into sending this information back to the server by setting the background-image of these styles to a specific URL. The server will then respond with HTTP Status 410 (Gone) to avoid any requests of these characteristics on subsequent reloads.</p>

<p>Font detection works a little differently; every font not installed on device will send a request. By comparing the differences between the requests and the full list of fonts, we can conclude what fonts are installed.</p>

<h2 id='css_cookie'>CSS Cookie</h2>

<p>We can also track visitors cross-origin by requesting an endpoint on the server that will return a permanent redirect (HTTP status 308) to a unique address. The browser will then permanently make requests to the previously generated unique address whenever the endpoint is requested. This creates a pure CSS cookie that is reminisent of the &#8217;<a href='https://supercookie.me/'>supercookie</a>&#8217; exploit. This cookie is stored for an unlimited amount of time; the only way to remove it is to fully clear the browser&#8217;s cache.</p>

<h2 id='why_is_this_important?'>Why is this important?</h2>

<p>This technique avoids anti-tracking methods such as NoScript, VPNs or browser extensions, as it requires no Javascript or Cookies to function.</p>

<p>Currently, this method is not scalable as it requires over 1MB of CSS downloads and hundreds of requests per user. However, with the next upcoming draft of the CSS specification, <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/'>CSS Values 4</a>, it may dramatically shrink the number of requests per user by allowing the use of custom variables in URLs.</p>

<p>Not only will the upcoming draft make this method scalable, but it will also increase its precision. Currently, without alternative means, it is hard to conclusively link every request to a specific visitor as the only feasible way to determine their origin is to group the requests by the IP address of the connection. However, with the new draft, by generating a randomized string and interpolating it into the URL tag for every visitor, we can accurately identify all requests from said visitor.</p>

<h2 id='why_this_method_beats_all_current_anti-fingerprinting_methods'>Why this method beats all current anti-fingerprinting methods</h2>

<p>Current anti-fingerprinting mostly focuses on the blocking or spoofing JavaScript APIs. If JavaScript is blocked we can detect it with CSS, at which point you could use server-side code to inject the CSS-based fingerprinting to detect the other characteristics of the device.</p>

<p>The other problem is the way in which most major browser currently treat permanent redirects in CSS files. CSS permenant redirects will always uniquely identify a user on a single origin without the need for client side code, however, currently most browsers cache permenant redirects in relation to the CSS document not the page origin - allowing for cross-origin tracking.</p>
